# Lagoon Lando Plugin

This is the _official_ [Lando](https://lando.dev) plugin for [Lagoon](https://lagoon.sh). When installed it...

* Closely mimics Lagoon's [stack, versions](https://docs.lagoon.sh/) locally
* Allows you to easily `pull` your Lagoon site down locally
* Allows you to easily `push` your changes back to Lagoon

Of course, once a user is running their Lagoon project with Lando they can take advantage of [all the other awesome development features](https://docs.lando.dev) Lando provides.


## Basic Usage

Clone a project down from Lagoon.

```bash
# Clone a site from a lagoon instance
lando init --source lagoon

# Start it up
lando start

# Pull down files and database
lando pull --database main --files main

# List information about this apps services.
lando info
```

Once your project is running you can access [relevant tooling commands](https://github.com/lando/lagoon/blob/main/docs/usage.md#application-tooling).
