# Lagoon Lando Plugin

This is the _official_ [Lando](https://lando.dev) plugin for [Lagoon](https://www.amazee.io/lagoon/). When installed it...

* Allows users to spin up their Lagoon projects for development with Lando
* Allows users to sync database relationships and mounts between Lagoon and Lando
* Uses Lagoon's own images for extremely close parity with production
* Uses Lagoon's own configuration files to determine what Lando should run and do
* Provides users with relevant and containerized tooling commands

Of course, once a user is running their Lagoon project with Lando they can take advantage of [all the other awesome development features](https://docs.lando.dev) Lando provides.

## Installation

This plugin is included with Lando by default. That means if you have Lando version `3.0.8` or higher then this plugin is already installed!

However if you would like to manually install the plugin, update it to the bleeding edge or install a particular version then use the below. Note that this installation method requires Lando `3.5.0+`.

```bash
# Ensure you have a global plugins directory
mkdir -p ~/.lando/plugins

# Install plugin
# NOTE: Modify the "yarn add @lando/lagoon" line to install a particular version eg
# yarn add @lando/lagoon@0.5.2
docker run --rm -it -v ${HOME}/.lando/plugins:/plugins -w /tmp node:14-alpine sh -c \
  "yarn init -y \
  && yarn add @lando/lagoon --production --flat --no-default-rc --no-lockfile --link-duplicates \
  && yarn install --production --cwd /tmp/node_modules/@lando/lagoon \
  && mkdir -p /plugins/@lando \
  && mv --force /tmp/node_modules/@lando/lagoon /plugins/@lando/lagoon"

# Rebuild the plugin cache
lando --clear
```

You should be able to verify the plugin is installed by running `lando config --path plugins` and checking for `@lando/lagoon`. This command will also show you _where_ the plugin is being loaded from.

## Basic Usage

Clone a project down from Lagoon.

```bash
# Make and go into an empty directory
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Clone down code from Lagoon
lando init --source lagoon

# Start the project up
lando start

# Pull down relationships and mounts
lando pull
```

Once your project is running you can access [relevant tooling commands](https://github.com/lando/lagoon/blob/main/docs/usage.md#application-tooling).


```yaml
name: lagoon-drupal9
recipe: lagoon
```
