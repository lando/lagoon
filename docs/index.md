title: Lagoon Lando Plugin
description: The best local development option for Lagoon a Docker Build and Deploy System for OpenShift & Kubernetes.

# Overview

[Lagoon](https://docs.lagoon.sh/lagoon/) solves what developers are dreaming about: A system that allows developers to locally develop their code and their services with Docker and run the exact same system in production. The same Docker images, the same service configurations and the same code.

This is currently an _beta_ level integration that has the following _serious caveats_:

* This _does not_ support Lagoon's `node`, `python` or `mongodb` containers yet
* It's not yet clear how much customization to your project is currently supported

However, if you'd like to try it out and give your feedback on what worked and what didn't then please continue.

You can report any issues or feedback [over here](https://github.com/lando/lagoon/issues/new/choose) or check out the [support page](./support.md).
